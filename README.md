# MovieLens_Project
Capstone's  MovieLens Project
 A recommendation system uses previously available data, in this case movie ratings, to predict ratings of movies that the user hasn't seen yet, recommend movies that the user could like (good rating predicted) and avoid movies that the user could dislike (bad rating predicted).  
 To achieve this, machine learning techniques are used. For this the MovieLens data set and specifically the 10M version is used (it has 10 millions ratings, 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users).  
 The predictors used by the machine learning algorithm are the movies(each movie has a set of ratings),the users(each user gives different movies different ratings) and the genres of movies (comedy,drama,action,etc.).After that, it uses regularization to penalize large estimates and generate better predictions. The desired RMSE is 0.86490.
